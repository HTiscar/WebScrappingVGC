# Web Scrapping VGC
This is a webscrapping project based on [ashaheedq vgchartzScrape](https://github.com/ashaheedq/vgchartzScrape). The purpose of this project was to learn the basics of using <b>BeautifulSoup4</b> and built upon on it another data analysis scripts in order to use the dataset offered by VGChartz to its fullest. 
 
 The first part of the project is dedicated to learn the basics of using proxies for scrapping purposes, with the aid of the <b>requests</b> class.

#Proxies / Scrapping Proxyscrape

There were little to no changes in the proxies_gen.py code and, if at any, all of them were variable name changes. You can review the original code at [ashaheedq vgchartzScrape](https://github.com/ashaheedq/vgchartzScrape). This add on is necessary for working with free proxies.
